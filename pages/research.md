1. [**Does the CDS Market Reflect Regulatory Climate Risk Disclosures?**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3616324) <br/>
   With Julian Kölbel, Markus Leippold and Qian Wang

    Using a forward-looking measure of climate risk exposure based on textual analysis of firms' 10-K reports, we assess whether climate risks — as disclosed to the regulator — are priced in the credit default swap (CDS) market. We construct a novel climate risk measure based on BERT, an advanced context-based language understanding algorithm, and we adapt it for our purposes. Differentiating between physical and transition risks, we find that transition risk increases CDS spreads, especially after the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. These increases are statistically and economically highly significant. However, we do not find such an effect for physical risk.

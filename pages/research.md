<b>Ask BERT: How Regulatory Disclosure of Transition and Physical Climate Risks affects the CDS Term Structure</b>
<br/>
With Julian KÃ¶lbel, Markus Leippold and Qian Wang, 2022, Journal of Financial econometrics [<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jfec/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jjfinec/nbac027/6650201" class=external>download</a>]

<p class="abstract">
We use BERT, an AI-based algorithm for language understanding, to quantify regulatory climate risk disclosures and analyze their impact on the term structure in the credit default swap (CDS) market. Risk disclosures can either increase or decrease CDS spreads, depending on whether the disclosure reveals new risks or reduces uncertainty. Training BERT to differentiate between transition and physical climate risks, we find that disclosing transition risks increases CDS spreads after the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, while disclosing physical risks decreases the spreads. In addition, we also find that the election of Trump had a negative impact on CDS spreads for firms exposed to transition risk. These impacts are consistent with theoretical predictions and economically and statistically significant.

<b>Beyond Climate: `EU taxonomy' criteria, materiality, and CDS term structure</b>
<br/>
With Andreas Hoepner, Johannes Klausmann and Markus Leippold [<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4351633" class="external">download</a>]
<p class="abstract">
This paper examines the impact of the EU Taxonomy's non-climate environmental criteria on the corporate credit risk term structure. We focus on infrastructure firm-level credit risk transmitted through CDS with differential maturities (e.g., ten-year minus one-year) in relation to biodiversity, water risks, and pollution prevention to understand the incentives created by these criteria for green infrastructure investments. Where these criteria describe risks of the environment for the firm (i.e., conventional materiality), we find that firms managing any of these three risks best have up to 93bps better relative long-term refinancing conditions than the worst ones. With respect to the second part of double materiality (i.e., the impact of the firm on the environment), we find statistically significant results only for pollution prevention of up to 70bps. Unexpected political right-wing shocks, such as the Trump election, had reversing effects on biodiversity and pollution prevention but not on water risks. These reversals were evident on the short end of the CDS curve but modest on the long end. Overall, our results suggest that investors appear to credit better management of the environmental criteria beyond climate with improved long-term financing conditions on infrastructure investments.

**Ask BERT: How Regulatory Disclosure of Transition and Physical Climate Risks affects the CDS Term Structure**
<br/>
With Julian KÃ¶lbel, Markus Leippold and Qian Wang (2022, Journal of Financial econometrics [[download](https://academic.oup.com/jfec/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jjfinec/nbac027/6650201)])

We use BERT, an AI-based algorithm for language understanding, to quantify regulatory climate risk disclosures and analyze their impact on the term structure in the credit default swap (CDS) market. Risk disclosures can either increase or decrease CDS spreads, depending on whether the disclosure reveals new risks or reduces uncertainty. Training BERT to differentiate between transition and physical climate risks, we find that disclosing transition risks increases CDS spreads after the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, while disclosing physical risks decreases the spreads. In addition, we also find that the election of Trump had a negative impact on CDS spreads for firms exposed to transition risk. These impacts are consistent with theoretical predictions and economically and statistically significant.
